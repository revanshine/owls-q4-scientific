Here’s a fast, opinionated review of your repo with concrete upgrades.

# What’s solid

* \#Docs-as-onboarding: The README is approachable and visual; it explains the aim (Q4 operator splitting) and shows results (scatter + heatmap). Good for non-experts and reviewers. ([GitHub][1])
* \#Results callouts: You clearly state key metrics—Energy Split = **1.0000**, SVD **64→50**, Anisotropy **0.0040**—so outcomes are legible at a glance. ([GitHub][1])
* \#Repo hygiene: Clear top-level structure (`README.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md`, `images/`, `src/`). `.gitignore` is present. ([GitHub][1])
* \#Stack signals: Language mix shows Python-heavy with HCL & Shell (infra + automation friendly). ([GitHub][1])

# Gaps / risks (prioritized)

1. **Reproducibility (highest ROI).**

   * I don’t see a pinned environment or one-liner to fully regenerate figures/metrics. Add `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`), lock versions, and a **Makefile** (`make setup|run|plots`) to produce the images + metrics end-to-end. Expose a fixed random seed. ([GitHub][1])

2. **API surface & CLI.**

   * Provide a tiny, sklearn-ish interface so others can *use* Q4 beyond the notebook/demo:
     `q4 = Q4(n_keep=k).fit(X); Xk, Xd = q4.transform(X)`; include `inverse_transform` if defined, plus a minimal CLI: `python -m owls_q4 run --data data/emb.csv`. (This will also make tests/CI straightforward.)

3. **Mathematical guarantees—encode them as tests.**

   * Unit/property tests for projector properties & invariants (with tolerances):

     * Idempotence: $P^2 \approx P$
     * Orthogonality: $P_\text{keep}P_\text{discard} \approx 0$
     * Completeness: $P_k + P_d \approx I$
     * Energy preservation split matches the reported 1.0000 within ε
     * Anisotropy metric correctness vs. synthetic baselines
   * Use `pytest` + `hypothesis` for randomized matrices.

4. **CI & quality gates.**

   * GitHub Actions: run tests, `ruff`/`black`, `mypy` on PR. Artifact upload of generated plots for review is a nice touch. (Repo shows **no releases** yet; this is a clean point to start tagging `v0.1.0` with CI.) ([GitHub][1])

5. **Data & licensing.**

   * If embeddings are real user-derived vectors, add `DATASET.md` with provenance/privacy notes and a synthetic fallback to allow full reproduction without restricted data.
   * I don’t see a license badge/section on the summary—add **Apache-2.0** or **MIT** so collaborators are unblocked. ([GitHub][1])

6. **Infra IaC (HCL present).**

   * If Terraform provisions buckets/compute for runs, include: `README` for state backend, `variables.tf` with sane defaults, example `*.tfvars`, and confirm no secrets/real state are committed. (HCL is \~28% of the repo languages, so it’s non-trivial.) ([GitHub][1])

7. **Benchmarks & scale notes.**

   * Results cite **500 × 64** vectors. Add a quick benchmark table for 10k×768 (LLM-ish) to document O(n·d²) hotspots, memory, and any `numba`/`torch` vectorization. ([GitHub][1])

8. **Research clarity.**

   * In `TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md`, add the explicit definitions you’re using (e.g., anisotropy formula, energy split, how projectors are learned, relation to PCA/SVD). A short “When Q4 beats plain PCA” section with a 2–3 case study table would help. (Your README hints at these but doesn’t formalize them.) ([GitHub][1])

# Quick wins you can land today

* **Add environment + runner**

  * `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`) with pinned versions
  * `Makefile`:

    * `make setup` → create venv & install
    * `make run` → compute metrics, write `artifacts/metrics.json`
    * `make plots` → regenerate `images/scatter.png`, `images/heatmap.png`
* **Minimal package skeleton**

  ```
  src/owls_q4/__init__.py
  src/owls_q4/q4.py          # class Q4(...).fit/transform/inverse_transform
  src/owls_q4/metrics.py     # energy split, anisotropy
  src/owls_q4/vis.py         # plotting helpers
  scripts/run_q4.py          # CLI entrypoint
  tests/test_q4_properties.py
  ```
* **CI (drop-in)**

  * Action: `python - on: [push, pull_request]; steps: setup-python, pip install -e .[dev], pytest, ruff, mypy`.
  * Cache pip; upload `images/` as artifacts.

# Suggested tests (sketch)

* Random orthonormal basis → learned $P_k$ should be symmetric/idempotent; `np.allclose(P@P, P, atol=1e-6)`
* Synthetic blob data with known subspace → Q4’s `keep` captures ≥X% variance vs. PCA‐k
* Anisotropy on i.i.d. Gaussian ≈ 0; introduce a directional bias and assert metric increases.

# Docs tweaks

* Add a **“How to reproduce this README”** section with the exact commands used to get:

  * Energy Split **1.0000**
  * SVD **64→50**
  * Anisotropy **0.0040**
    and paths to the images produced. ([GitHub][1])
* Link **Technical Details** from the README where those formulas live, and add a tiny glossary (projector, energy, anisotropy). ([GitHub][1])

# Publishing / collaboration

* Tag `v0.1.0` once CI is green; cut a **Release** with wheels and a short changelog. ([GitHub][1])
* Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
* If you want academic-style citations, wire Zenodo for a DOI.
